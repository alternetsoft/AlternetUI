---

Here is how to declare a <xref:Alternet.UI.!!!> in UIXML:
[!code-xml[](examples/ExampleWindow.uixml#CreateUixmlDeclaration)]

And the corresponding event handler in the code-behind:
[!code-csharp[](examples/ExampleWindow.uixml.cs#EventHandler)]

Also, a <xref:Alternet.UI.!!!> can be created from code:
[!code-csharp[](examples/ExampleWindow.uixml.cs#CSharpCreation)]
