# Using StatusBar
  
The AlterNET UI <xref:Alternet.UI.StatusBar> control is used as an area, usually displayed
at the bottom of a window, in which an application can display various kinds of status information.
<xref:Alternet.UI.StatusBar> controls can have status bar panels on them that display text to indicate
state; for example, that the document is being saved.  
  
## Using the StatusBar Control  
Internet Explorer uses a status bar to indicate the URL of a page when the mouse rolls over the hyperlink; Microsoft
Word gives you information on page location, section location, and editing modes such as overtype and revision tracking;
and Visual Studio uses the status bar to give context-sensitive information, such as telling you how to manipulate
dockable windows as either docked or floating.  
  
A status bar is divided into panels to display information by using the <xref:Alternet.UI.StatusBar.Panels> property.
