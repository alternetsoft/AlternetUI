# Toolbars
  
The AlterNET UI <xref:Alternet.UI.Toolbar> control is used a control bar that displays a row of drop-down menus and
bitmapped buttons that activate commands. Thus, clicking a toolbar button is equivalent to choosing a menu command. The
buttons can be configured to appear and behave as push buttons, drop-down menus, or separators. Typically, a toolbar
contains buttons and menus that correspond to items in an application's menu structure, providing quick access to an
application's most frequently used functions and commands.
