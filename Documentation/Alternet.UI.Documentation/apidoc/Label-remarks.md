<xref:Alternet.UI.Label> controls are typically used to provide descriptive text for a control.
For example, you can use a <xref:Alternet.UI.Label> to add descriptive text for a <xref:Alternet.UI.TextBox> control to inform the
user about the type of data expected in the control. <xref:Alternet.UI.Label> controls can also be used
to add descriptive text to a <xref:Alternet.UI.Window> to provide the user with helpful information.
For example, you can add a <xref:Alternet.UI.Label> to the top of a <xref:Alternet.UI.Window> that provides instructions
to the user on how to input data in the controls on the form. <xref:Alternet.UI.Label> controls can also be used to display
 run time information on the status of an application. For example,
you can add a <xref:Alternet.UI.Label> control to a form to display the status of each file as a list of files is processed.
