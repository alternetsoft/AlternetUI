Here is how to declare a <xref:Alternet.UI.Slider> in UIXML:
[!code-xml[](examples/ExampleWindow.uixml#CreateUixmlDeclaration)]

And the corresponding event handler in the code-behind:
[!code-csharp[](examples/ExampleWindow.uixml.cs#SliderEventHandler)]

Also a <xref:Alternet.UI.Slider> can be created from code:
[!code-csharp[](examples/ExampleWindow.uixml.cs#SliderCSharpCreation)]
