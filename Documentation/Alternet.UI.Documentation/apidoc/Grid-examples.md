---

Here is how to declare a <xref:Alternet.UI.Grid> in UIXML:
[!code-xml[](../../../Source/Samples/ApiDocDll/AllWindows/GridWindow.uixml#CreateUixmlDeclaration)]

And the corresponding event handler in the code-behind:
[!code-csharp[](../../../Source/Samples/ApiDocDll/AllWindows/GridWindow.uixml.cs#GridEventHandler)]

Also, 
a <xref:Alternet.UI.Grid> can be created from code:
[!code-csharp[](../../../Source/Samples/ApiDocDll/AllWindows/GridWindow.uixml.cs#GridCSharpCreation)]
