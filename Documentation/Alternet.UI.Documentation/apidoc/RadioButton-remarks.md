uid: Alternet.UI.RadioButton
remarks: *content
---

When the user selects one radio button (also known as an option button) within a group, the others clear automatically.
All <xref:Alternet.UI.RadioButton> controls in a given container, such as a <xref:Alternet.UI.Window>, constitute a group.
To create multiple groups on one window, place each group in its own container, such as a <xref:Alternet.UI.GroupBox>.

<xref:Alternet.UI.RadioButton> and <xref:Alternet.UI.CheckBox> controls have a similar function: they offer choices a user can select or clear.
The difference is that multiple <xref:Alternet.UI.CheckBox> controls can be selected at the same time, but option buttons are mutually exclusive.
