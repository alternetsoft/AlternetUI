You can place a fixed version of the WebView2 Edge runtime in the appropriate
subfolder of this folder. In this case it will be used instead of the 
globally installed runtime. Subfolders:

win-arm64	- WebView2 runtime for a 64-bit ARM processor architecture.
win-x64		- WebView2 runtime for an Intel-based 64-bit processor architecture.
win-x86		- WebView2 runtime for an Intel-based 32-bit processor architecture.
