AlterNET UI is a cross-platform .NET UI framework that allows the development of light-footprint .NET desktop applications that runs on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** with Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

It is built on top of the .NET Framework and uses a XAML-like approach to define user interface and layout. It provides a set of standard controls that looks native on the target OS, such as Text Box, Label, CheckBox, Button, Image, TreeViews, ListView, and more. 

The framework includes a platform-independent graphic device interface for rendering graphical objects, such as fonts, brushes, images, and a layout engine.

For increased developer productivity, [AlterNET UI extension for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlternetSoftwarePTYLTD.AlternetUIForVS2022) is available.

AlterNET UI Beta 2 represents a significant milestone toward releasing a production-ready cross-platform .NET UI framework for developing desktop applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
In this release, we have implemented some major features primarily adopted from the WPF framework: Layout Engine, Dependency Properties, Data Binding, Keyboard and Mouse Input, Routed Events, and more.

AlterNET UI Beta 3 adds important features like menus, keyboard shortcuts, commands, modal windows, advanced window management, and more.

AlterNET UI Beta 4 adds support for UIXML preview in Visual Studio, drag-and-drop, clipboard, common dialogs, thread synchronization, context menus, and more.

In AlterNET UI Beta 5, we have added support for some missing functionality as well as wrapping up the features that were previously released. These include printing and print preview support, a much more complete implementation of DrawingContext, tray icons, and tooltips.

AlterNET UI Beta 6 adds many advanced features to the standard control set and several new controls: Toolbar and StatusBar. The amended controls include TreeView, ListView, ComboBox, ListBox, Slider, ProgressBar, TabControl, Window, and Button. 

AlterNET UI Beta 9 adds WebBrowser control, improvements and bug fixes to other controls.
