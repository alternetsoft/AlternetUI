This is minimal project template to use with Alternet.UI latest master version from github.

Limitations:

- You need to edit MinMaster.csproj file and change "AlternetUISourcePath" property
to the path where Alternet.UI Source folder is located.
- Uixml forms are not supported by this template. You need to create forms and controls
from code. See MainWindow.cs for an example.
