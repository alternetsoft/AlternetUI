## 2024 February 23

- Hidden AuiManager and other Aui* controls. The reason is that they do not work properly on Linux and MacOs. Also
they are very limited. We suggest using TabControl, SideBarPanel, ToolBar, Splitter, SplittedPanel instead of Aui* controls.
- Hidden Sizer* objects and interfaces. As we introduced Control.Layout property, all Sizer* functionality can be 
implemented through this or using StackPanel, Grid and other layout related containers.

- TabControl.SetTabImage.
- TabControl.DisplayRectangle.
- SpeedButton.Text is now displayed if needed.

- <u>**Uixml to Cs generator change.**</u>. Now it is not allowed to specify event handlers in the Uixml 
if control has no Name property specified. Previously it was possible but raised an exception in some cases. 
- Display: AllScreens, Bounds, BoundsDip, DeviceName.
- Application.IsRunning.
- ThreadExceptionWindow fixed and improved: Removed exception when its used. Now it is possible to specify whether to
 show Continue button. Layout is improved. Keys Esc and Enter work now. Added localization for buttons.

- Application: DefaultIcon, IdleLog.
- Control: LayoutData, LayoutProps.
- Threading sample (ControlsSample/InternalSamples/ThreadingSample) improved. Added correct thread cancellation when form is closed.
- Hidden AuiManager sample. Currently we can't suggest to use AuiManager and other Aui* controls. 
After testing it's features and functionality, we found that it works badly under Linux and MacOs. 
Also there are some limitations in the Aui* controls which are critical. Currently we suggest to use:
SplittedPanel as a container for sidebars, SideBarPanel as a simple tabcontrol for sidebars, GenericToolBar as a toolbar.

# 0.9.506 (2024 February 14)

## 2024 February 14

### Layout improvement:

Added Control.Layout property. Now it is possible to specify layout method for any control. 
Old way:

```xml
<GroupBox Padding="5" Margin="0,5,0,0">
	<VerticalStackPanel>
		<Label Text="Last Item" Margin="0,0,0,10"/>
		<Button Text="To View" Click="ScrollLastItemIntoViewButton_Click"/>
	</VerticalStackPanel>
</GroupBox>
```

New way:

```xml
<GroupBox Layout="Vertical" Padding="5" Margin="0,5,0,0">
	<Label Text="Last Item" Margin="0,0,0,10"/>
	<Button Text="To View" Click="ScrollLastItemIntoViewButton_Click"/>
</GroupBox>
```

So we do not need to add extra StackPanel or other containers, we can just specify 
Layout="Vertical" in the parent control in order to change default layout style.

Currently these layouts are implemented: None, Dock, Basic, Vertical, Horizontal.

- None: No layout. Use Bounds and Size properties to move/resize child controls.
- Basic: Default layout for the Control. VerticalAlignment, HorizontalAlignment and SuggestedSize properties 
are used to layout the child controls.
- Vertical, Horizontal: StackPanel like alignment. Also opposite bound can be aligned via
VerticalAlignment and HorizontalAlignment properties.
- Dock: Control.Dock property is used to align the child controls.

Control.GetDefaultLayout() virtual method returns default layout in the control. 
For example, Control returns LayoutStyle.Basic, VerticalStackPanel returns LayoutStyle.Vertical.
It allows to specify used layout in case when Layout property is null (by default).

Element 'Fill' was added to VerticalAlignment and HorizontalAlignment enums. It allows to
layout the child control so it will occupy the remaining empty space of the container.

### Other improvements and changes:

- Renamed Toolbar -> ToolBar, Window.Toolbar -> Window.ToolBar.
- Control: ChildRemoved, ChildInserted, ChildVisibleChanged events.
- Window: ToolBar property is now Control.
- Window: StatusBar property is now FrameworkElement.
- LayoutDirection enum and property were renamed to LangDirection.
- Splitter: Now works faster.

## 2024 February 12

- Control: AllChildren, AllChildrenInLayout.
- SideBarPanel.TabAlignment.
- StackPanel: Improved aligment. Now child's VerticalAlignment property (Stretched, Top and Bottom) 
can be used to specify vertical alignment. For the example see SideBarPanel control.
Previously all childs were aligned to top.
- StackPanel: IsVertical, IsHorizontal.
- Improved popup windows behavior on MacOs.
- Control: MouseEnter, MouseLeave now use BubbleMouse.
- PropertyGridSample: Add SideBarPanel demo.
- Updated used Nuget packages #85.

## 2024 February 11

- PopupWindow: Add Ok and Cancel buttons on bottom.

On some Linux systems window manager doesn't allow to position the form, so all popups will be centered. 
Previously popup forms were shown in strange positions on some Linux systems.
- PopupWindow.ModalPopups.
- PopupWindow: System window border is used instead of Border control.
- PopupWindow: By default popup is now resizable.
- Improved PopupCheckListBox and added it's demo in ControlsSample.
