The problem was solved using the resources mentioned in the Cart:

I chose the Humanist font set:


font-family: Seravek, 'Gill Sans Nova', Ubuntu, Calibri, 'DejaVu Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;


When I switched to these in my experiments, I immediately realized that my eyes somehow felt better right away. This was probably the main selection criterion. Later I read in the description of this font family:


These typefaces are inspired by the handwriting of the Renaissance period and are often considered to be more legible and easier to read than other sans-serif typefaces.
