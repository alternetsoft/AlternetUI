In the Registry Editor, go to the following branch on the left:
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM.

Now, right-click the DWM key in the left pane, and select New > Dword (32-bit) value from the menu.
Create New Dword Value
Name the new value UseWindowFrameStagingBuffer. It will be set to zero by default, so don't change it.

UseWindowFrameStagingBuffer
Restart Windows 11, and you are done.

That's it. To undo the change later, remove the UseWindowFrameStagingBuffer you created earlier,
 and restart the OS to apply the modification.
